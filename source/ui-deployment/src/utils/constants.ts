does not own or otherwise have any control over (“Third-Party GAI Models”).
Your use of the Third-Party GAI Models is governed by the terms provided to you

You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Third-Party GAI Models comply
with the terms governing them, and any laws, rules, regulations, policies, or standards
that apply to you. You are also responsible for making your own independent assessment

GAI Model providers use any data that may be transmitted to them based on your deployment
configuration. AWS does not make any representations, warranties, or guarantees regarding
